# Dog-Fetcher
Fetches all good boy info from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

A simple app that displays data from an API endpoint. Uses Dagger 2, Retrofit, data binding, and Android Architecture Components like ViewModels and LiveData

A couple caveats: This is my first 100% Kotlin app, as well as the first time I've tried using the AACs.
